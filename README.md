# Go Problems

This is a series of problems in Go. They are not ordered in any way (so far).
There will be a [problem].go file and a [problem]_test.go file.
The first is where you'll write your solution and the second is for the unit tests.
Feel free to look at the tests and see what they are doing. If you make any accidental changes,
you can revert it by running `git checkout [filename]`.

## Running your solution

If you want to double check your solution before you run it, make sure to set up a main function
to call your code from. Once you have your file ready to run, run `go run .` in the problem directory.
This will run just your solution file.

## Test your solution

You don't need a main function to test your solution. Just run `go test .` in the problem file.
