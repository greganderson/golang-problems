# Fizzbuzz

Write a function `Fizzbuzz(n int) []string` that takes an integer `n` and returns a slice of strings representing the numbers from 1 to `n`.
But for multiples of three, return `"fizz"` instead of the number, and for multiples of five,
return `"buzz"`. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, return `"fizzbuzz"`.

Ex:
Input: `5`
Output: `["1", "2", "fizz", "4", "buzz"]`
